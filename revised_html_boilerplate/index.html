	<h2>Practice is the key to Success</h2>
	<p>The meaning of proverb <strong>‘Practice makes a man Perfect’</strong> is, to succeed in life in any particular
		field or subject, one need to practice regularly with full commitment and planned strategies. <strong>Getting
			success is not an easy phenomenon; it needs knowledge, skill and most importantly the regular
			practice.</strong> If you desire to be a world-class famous musician, you need to buy an instrument, arrange
		a good teacher, learn and practice on it daily for required hours. There is no power which can make you
		<strong><em>Kapil Dev or Sachin Tendulkar</em></strong> over night merely through the inborn skill or complete
		knowledge about cricket. You cannot reach to the target without committed practice. You have to go to the
		cricket field every day for hours to practice cricket under the guidance of a good and highly skilled coach.You
		need to take care of the very little mistakes to bring perfection in the same work you are doing as well as obey
		your guide with respect. If we see the list of successful people, we see that there is regular practice and
		involvement with full commitment in their work. Students, who achieve good marks or rank in board examinations,
		have studied throughout the year with planned time table and open eyes. They have revised and re-revised their
		syllabus and made themselves perfect in all the subjects. <strong>There is no alternate to the regular practice
			which can make one perfect.</strong> Without practice you can give only average performance but not perfect
		performance in any work.
